abstract:
- content: "This engineering report presents the results of a concept development
    study on a\r\nMarine Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), sponsored by the National
    Geospatial-\r\nIntelligence Agency (NGA) - Maritime Safety Office (MSO), on behalf
    of the\r\nInternational Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the IHO MSDI Working
    Group\r\n(MSDIWG), and executed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The goal
    of\r\nthis study was to demonstrate to stakeholders the diversity, richness and
    value of a\r\nMarine SDI – specifically data, analysis, interoperability and associated
    IT services\r\n- including web services - in addressing needs of the marine domain."
